AC:

There was no edge between 17->13. 13 is not in DFS tree of 17

Here is what 17 leads to

17->12->4, where 4 is execCode.

17: vulExists('10.10.10.1','CVE-2015-2808',safari,remoteExploit,privEscalation)
12: RULE Node
4: execCode('10.10.10.1',someUser)

so 4 has centrality: 0.455, hence 17 will also have updated centrality value 0.455
